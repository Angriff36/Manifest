0a. Study `docs/spec/*` using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 250 parallel subagents) to learn the Manifest language specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `/specs` using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 250 parallel subagents) to understand additional functionality of the project.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/manifest/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use Task tool with up to 500 parallel subagents (subagent_type='Explore') to study existing source code in `src/*` and contract definitions in `docs/spec/*` and compare it against `specs/ergonomics/manifest-config-ergonomics.md` . Use Task tool with subagent_type='Opus' or model='opus' to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented and any **NONCOMFORMANCE**. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete. IMPORTANT: Always use the Task tool for file operations, searches, and analysis - never use Read/Grep directly for exploration work.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore'. Treat `docs/spec/*` as the project's source of truth definitions of behavior. If anything conflicts with `docs/spec/*` then IMMEDIATELY mark it as **NONCONFORMING** with a reference to the rule it breaks and note it in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md thoroughly. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve Zero trial-and-error debugging of configuration issues. Every contract mismatch, missing policy, property typo, and context gap is caught before a single request is made.. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at `docs/proposals/FILENAME.md`. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
