# Manifest Compliance Matrix

**Authority:** Binding for **Manifest-owned** feature-completion claims.  
**Enforced by:** `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/internal/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md` (`@RYAN_APPROVED 2026-07-15`).

**Ownership boundary (canonical):** [`docs/internal/contracts/manifest-builder-boundary.md`](./contracts/manifest-builder-boundary.md)

| Owner | Owns |
| ----- | ---- |
| **Manifest** | Language/syntax; compiler, AST, IR; runtime semantics; projections; analysis/verification APIs; stable public SDK contracts |
| **Builder** | Visual editing; workspace/project management; presets; projection orchestration; generated-app assembly; consumer wiring inspection; verification/debugging UI; generated-app lifecycle |

Builder consumption / end-to-end proof lives in Builder’s matrix:  
`C:\projects\builder\docs\CAPABILITY_CONSUMPTION_MATRIX.md` (repo-relative from Builder: `docs/CAPABILITY_CONSUMPTION_MATRIX.md`).

~~Earlier 2026-07-15 drafts of this matrix only listed ~12 proven fixes + ~30 gaps and a short “existence” dump — that was **not** a complete feature inventory.~~  
~~Correction that treated product UI / Capsule adoption / kitchen tutorials as Manifest “missing features.”~~  
**Correction (2026-07-15):** This file enumerates **Manifest-owned** language, runtime, stores, **each** registered projection, CLI/SDK, packaging, and open **Manifest** gaps. Builder-owned work is `OUT_OF_SCOPE` here (tracked in Builder). Rows without filename+lines+commit stay `CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF` (or weaker) — never invent `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED`.

## Proof Protocol

| Status                | Meaning                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED`   | Manifest end-to-end + tests; **requires** filename + line range + git commit SHA |
| `PARTIAL`             | Present but incomplete across Manifest consumers/layers                   |
| `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY`     | Loud unsupported path; no full enforcement                                |
| `REJECTED_LOUD`       | Compile/schema rejects until designed                                     |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`     | Missing / passthrough / phantom **in Manifest**                           |
| `OUT_OF_SCOPE`        | Not a Manifest-core deliverable (often Builder-owned)                     |
| `CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF` | Exists in inventory/fixtures but **no** commit proof yet — **not** “done” |

Update this matrix first when closing Manifest work; then reconcile `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/CONFIRMED-FEATURES.md`.

## Integration status (Manifest × Builder)

These states are **orthogonal** to implementation status above. A Manifest gap is never “fixed” by Builder UI. Builder-owned work is never a Manifest `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` row.

| Integration state       | Meaning |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `MANIFEST_COMPLETE`     | Manifest matrix marks the capability `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` (hard proof) **or** the published SDK surface is declared stable and present for that capability |
| `BUILDER_CONSUMED`      | Builder’s consumption matrix records a real import of the Manifest public API + Builder implementation location |
| `END_TO_END_VERIFIED`   | `MANIFEST_COMPLETE` **and** `BUILDER_CONSUMED` **and** a focused Builder test proves consumption (see Builder matrix “Focused test” column) |

Do **not** write `END_TO_END_VERIFIED` in this file without a matching Builder matrix row. Track consumption details only in Builder.

### Platform SDK integration ledger (summary)

Pin / consumption evidence: Builder `package.json` currently pins `@angriff36/manifest@3.6.3` (Manifest SoT version is `package.json` — verify before asserting). Detail rows: Builder matrix.

| Manifest public API | Manifest status | Integration (as of 2026-07-15) |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `@angriff36/manifest/ir-compiler` (`compile`) | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` → see Builder matrix |
| `@angriff36/manifest/multi-compiler` | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/projections` (generate / list / capabilities / descriptors) | PARTIAL (capabilities declared incrementally) + §1 for APIs | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/runtime-engine` | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/ir-diff` + `/breaking-change` | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/projections/wiring` | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/agent-sdk` | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/language-metadata` | FULLY_IMPLEMENTED (§1) | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` (candidate `END_TO_END_VERIFIED` if Builder test green) |
| `@angriff36/manifest/seed-pack` + convex assembly helpers | CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF / shipped | `BUILDER_CONSUMED` (preset path) |
| Stable export contract (`docs/spec/sdk-stability.md`) | FULLY_IMPLEMENTED (§1) | `MANIFEST_COMPLETE` — Builder must stay on listed subpaths |

Agents: when auditing a feature page, update the matching row; do not invent completion from the page alone.

## 10. Coverage honesty

| Source                                 | Role vs this matrix                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/internal/contracts/manifest-builder-boundary.md` | **Ownership law** — what belongs in this matrix vs Builder |
| `C:\projects\builder\docs\CAPABILITY_CONSUMPTION_MATRIX.md` | Builder consumption + `BUILDER_CONSUMED` / `END_TO_END_VERIFIED` evidence |
| `docs/CONFIRMED-FEATURES.md`           | Existence narrative — must not claim completion beyond this file                               |
| `docs/FEATURE-LIST.md`                 | Historical roadmap (2026-06-02); **not** completion SoT; use to find missing **Manifest** rows |
| `docs/features/*.md`                   | User guides — each Manifest capability should appear as a row above                            |
| `docs/TODO.md`                         | Working checklist (Manifest gaps; Builder items must be `OUT_OF_SCOPE` or moved)               |
| Conformance fixtures                   | Executable semantics evidence pointers                                                         |
| Appendix D phantoms (2026-07-01 audit) | Names that must appear as `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` / struck claims until fixed                        |

When a **Manifest-owned** feature is found in any of those sources but missing here: **add a row immediately** (even as `CLAIMED_NEEDS_PROOF` or `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`). When the capability is Builder-owned: mark `OUT_OF_SCOPE` here and add/update the Builder consumption matrix — do **not** treat it as a missing Manifest implementation.

**Still not one-row-per-FEATURE-LIST-entry:** FEATURE-LIST has overlapping/historical names. Prefer CONFIRMED + fixtures + `builtins.ts` + CLI index as the enumeration sources; pull FEATURE-LIST names in when they describe a distinct Manifest capability not already listed.
