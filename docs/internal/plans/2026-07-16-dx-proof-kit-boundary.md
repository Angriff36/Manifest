# DX Proof Kit — dependency boundary

**Created:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Binding for the first vertical slice (IngredientDemand_confirm → PurchaseNeed)

## Ownership

| Surface | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability catalog + proof-registry schemas/emit/validate | Manifest | Derived from IR + projection metadata; never hand-maintained inventories |
| Integration guard engine | Manifest | App supplies feature roots / exceptions / rollout only |
| `@angriff36/manifest/proof-kit` | Manifest | Core APIs; **must not** import `convex-test` |
| `@angriff36/manifest/proof-kit/convex-test` | Manifest | Optional adapter; `convex-test` + `convex` are optional peers |
| Runtime proof cases, scenario fixtures, product-decision markers | Capsule | Application-owned |
| Feature-root guard wrappers | Capsule | Thin config over Manifest engine (Supply first) |

## Dependency rule

- Capsule installs `convex-test` (and `@edge-runtime/vm`) as **devDependencies**.
- Compatible pin for Capsule’s installed Convex **1.42.x**: `convex-test@0.0.54` (official peer `convex@^1.32.0`).
- Importing `@angriff36/manifest` or `@angriff36/manifest/proof-kit` must succeed with **no** `convex-test` installed.
- Only `@angriff36/manifest/proof-kit/convex-test` may reference `convex-test`.

## Vertical slice (this pass)

`IngredientDemand.confirm` → emit `IngredientDemandConfirmed` → reaction `PurchaseNeed.create`.

Deferred: Event/Culinary guard migration, broad reaction rollout, Explorer, Builder, receipt→stock.

## Capsule consumption (vertical slice)

Until `@angriff36/manifest` is cut-released with `./proof-kit`, Capsule may pin
`file:../Manifest` locally to consume the new subpaths. After cut-release, pin
the published exact version again (no `^`).
