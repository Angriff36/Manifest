This folder is a label layer only.

Contracts are binding language law, and the **canonical** location is:

- `docs/spec/**`

Do not create a second copy of normative files here.
Do not split authority between `docs/spec/**` and `docs/contracts/**`.

If you are looking for the executable contract anchor, start with:

- `docs/spec/ir/ir-v1.schema.json`

If you are looking for runtime meaning and enforcement:

- `docs/spec/semantics.md`
- `docs/spec/conformance.md`
- `src/manifest/conformance/**`

If you need clear scope boundaries for common infra-style questions:

- `docs/contracts/deployment-boundaries.md`
