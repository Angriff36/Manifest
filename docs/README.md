# Manifest docs (Capsule-Pro)

This directory holds **Capsule-Pro–specific** Manifest documentation: integration specs, migration guides, patterns, and tool usage.

## Official Manifest documentation

For the canonical Manifest language spec, IR schema, and upstream docs, see:

- **[../manifest-official](../manifest-official)** — symlink to the official Manifest repo’s `docs/` (definitive spec, semantics, builtins, conformance).

Use that for language rules, IR schema, and runtime semantics. Use the content in this directory for how Capsule-Pro integrates and extends Manifest.
