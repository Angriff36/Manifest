0a. Study `docs/spec/*` using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 250 parallel subagents) to learn the Manifest language specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 250 parallel subagents) to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/manifest/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use Task tool with up to 500 parallel subagents (subagent_type='Explore') to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `docs/spec/*`. Use Task tool with subagent_type='Opus' or model='opus' to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete. IMPORTANT: Always use the Task tool for file operations, searches, and analysis - never use Read/Grep directly for exploration work.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first using Task tool with subagent_type='Explore'. Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve Manifest vNext - a complete implementation of constraint severity levels (ok/warn/block), constraint overrides with authorization, command-level constraints, optimistic concurrency controls, and all 27 conformance fixtures passing. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at docs/spec/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
