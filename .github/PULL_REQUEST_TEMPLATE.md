## PR Checklist
- [ ] Changes comply with AGENTS.md normative preamble
- [ ] Changes comply with house-style.md (no semantic weakening, no implicit guards, no permissive defaults)
- [ ] No behavior change makes an invalid Manifest program succeed
- [ ] Any diagnostics added are observational only (no execution impact)
- [ ] No edits to semantics.md unless explicitly justified as a language change

If any box cannot be checked, explain why in plain language here:
